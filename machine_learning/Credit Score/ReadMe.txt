Project: Multi-Class Credit Score Classification

Description:
Welcome to the Multi-Class Credit Score Classification project! This project focuses on predicting creditworthiness across multiple categories using advanced machine learning techniques. Gain hands-on experience in multi-class classification and enhance your skills in credit risk assessment.

Objectives:
1. Explore and preprocess the credit data, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling class imbalance.
2. Implement and evaluate various machine learning algorithms for multi-class classification, such as decision trees, random forests.
3. Interpret and communicate the results of the classification models, gaining insights into the factors influencing different credit score categories.
