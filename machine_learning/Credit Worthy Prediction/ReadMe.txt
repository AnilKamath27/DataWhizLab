Project: Credit Worthy Prediction

Description:
The objective of this project is to analyze a credit worthiness dataset obtained from a financial institution. The dataset contains various features related to credit applicants, such as account balance, credit amount, payment status of previous credit, employment length, age, and more. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and applying machine learning algorithms, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing credit worthiness and develop a predictive model to classify applicants as either creditworthy or not.

Through this project, we will preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, perform feature engineering if required, and visualize the relationships between different features and credit worthiness. We will then train and evaluate machine learning models using techniques like CatBoost and explore their performance in predicting creditworthiness.

Learning Objectives:
By working on this project, you will:
1. Gain hands-on experience in analyzing and preprocessing credit worthiness data.
2. Develop proficiency in implementing machine learning algorithms for binary classification tasks.
3. Learn how to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and ROC AUC.
4. Understand the importance of feature engineering and visualization techniques in extracting meaningful insights from the data.
5. Explore the factors influencing creditworthiness and their predictive power.
6. Gain insights into the strengths and limitations of the CatBoost algorithm for binary classification tasks.

Through this project, you will enhance your skills in data analysis, machine learning, and interpreting the results of predictive models. You will also gain valuable knowledge about creditworthiness assessment and its practical applications in the financial domain.

Good luck with your credit worthiness prediction project! Enjoy the learning journey and the process of uncovering valuable insights from the data.
