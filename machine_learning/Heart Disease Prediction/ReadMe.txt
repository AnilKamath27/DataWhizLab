Project: Heart Disease Prediction

Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a heart disease prediction model using binary classification techniques. The dataset contains various demographic and clinical features of patients, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing heart disease and create an accurate prediction model.

Learning Objectives:
By working on this project, you will:
1. Gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis techniques specific to heart disease prediction.
2. Develop proficiency in implementing the XGBoost algorithm and utilizing GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
3. Learn how to evaluate the performance of a classification model using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and ROC score.
4. Acquire skills in interpreting feature importance and understanding the impact of different risk factors on heart disease prediction.
5. Enhance your ability to communicate and present the results of a machine learning project effectively.

Embark on this exciting journey of heart disease prediction and leverage your skills to make a meaningful impact in the field of healthcare and patient well-being!

Happy learning and analyzing!
